- Steps to create a SPA (Single Page application)

  - What is a single page application?
  The application displaying information on a single page, where the complete information is present on one page only.
  - The way that one navigates the page is by clicking on some buttons which intiates the navigation of page vertically, without changing the core url.
  - The essential thing is to clear content when needed, so that the scrolling can only show one single thing to the user.

- How is this enabled here?
  - have eventListeners on the buttons, as some buttom is clicked:
    - clear the content that was initially on the page
    - populate the new content

- Components needed for this change:
  - A function that clears the content from the page or the section where the page is loaded
  - A master function that shows default page at the same time clearning other content that should be visible on the page (To establish the initial state of the application)
